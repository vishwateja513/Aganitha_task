# Aganitha_task

This repository was cloned from https://github.com/vishwateja513/Aganitha_task.git and was empty at the time of cloning.

This README provides a focused template and next steps to initialize the project.

## Status

- Repository state: empty (no source files) as of 2025-10-27.

## Suggested project description

Replace this section with a one-sentence summary of the project, for example:

## Getting started

Use this template to document how to set up and run the project once sources are added.

- npm or yarn

# from the repository root
npm install

## Contributing

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/short-description`
2. Commit changes with clear messages
3. Open a pull request to the `main` branch

## Next steps (you or I can do these)

2. Update this README with a real project description and usage examples.
3. Add a license file (e.g., `LICENSE`) and a `.gitignore`.

If you'd like, I can:

- initialize a React app inside this repo (create-react-app or Vite),
- or copy the current `test_hextgen` project files into this repo and update the README to match that project.

Tell me which option you prefer and I'll proceed.
