# Aganitha_task â€” Book Finder (merged)

This repository now contains a small React application (Book Finder) that was added to the repo. The app was bootstrapped with Create React App and provides a simple UI to search the Open Library API for books.

This README combines the original repository template and the Create React App README, and contains quick start instructions below.

## Notes about this merge

- The repository previously had a template README; this file was merged with the CRA README and updated to describe the Book Finder app and how to run it.
- If you want the README split into finer sections or want additional usage examples, I can update it.
